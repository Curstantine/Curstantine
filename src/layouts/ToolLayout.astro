				Guck! You find yourself alone in this strange place, cut off from everything familiar. Your thoughts
				begin to wander with growing curiosityâ€”what lies beyond? What secrets are kept here? As you wait in this
				peculiar limbo, you notice something: certain paths are sealed off, certain doors remain closed. Signs
				of work in progress, of things not yet ready to be revealed. Tools scattered about. Dust sheets covering
				mysterious shapes.

				not yet complete. Still being crafted, refined, prepared for their proper unveiling."
